> 2. 主语从句
> 3. 同位语从句
> 4. 表语从句

### 虚拟语气

|                | 从句                                         | 主句                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 与现在事实相反 | did / were                                   | would(should / could / might) do        |
| 与过去事实相反 | had done                                     | would(should / could / might) have done |
| 与将来事实相反 | did / were; <br />were to do;<br />should do | would(should / could / might) do        |

#### 特殊虚拟

```wiki
(But for) the English examination, I would have gone to the exhibition last Sunday.
	要不是英语考试,我上个星期天将会去展会
  But for 要不是，虚拟条件暗含在 but for 中，主句用情态动词的 完成时
```



### 表语从句

```wiki
在系动词（be, remain, become, look, seem等）后面做表语的从句就是表语从句。表语从句可以由that, what, when, how, where, who, why, which, whether, as if, as though等引导。
注,引导词: as if / as though 好像 ;  because 因为

五感五变,四保持,两似乎,一证明

引导词demo:
It seems as if he didn't know the answer. 好像他不知道答案

It was as though she had known Millie for years. 好像她认识米莉已经好多年似的

That's because we never thought of it. 这是因为我们从未想过此事
```



```wiki
1.表语从句与宾语从句根本相同。如
The problem is who we can get to replace her.
That's why we had to put off the meeting.(put off：延期)

2.作表语的不定式短语通常是说明主语的内容，这时主语通常是如下名词：
hope, idea, job, plan, wish, aim, purpose, thing, business
The purpose of new technologies is to make life easier, not to make it more difficult.
新技术的目的是使生活更便利，而不是更繁琐。

Her wish is to bee a singer.
她的愿望是当一名歌手。

Our plan is to finish the work in two weeks.
我们的方案就是在两星期内完成这项工作。

The patient is out of danger.
病人脱险了。

This is what he said.
这就是他所说的话。

3.表语从句一定要用正常语序。
False: The question is when can he arrive at the hotel.
Right: The question is when he can arrive at the hotel.

4.引导名词性从句时if/whether(是否)用法辨析：
if不能引导表语从句，只能用 whether 来引导。
引导宾语从句时if/whether可以互换，但介词后面的宾语从句只能用 whether 来引导。
位于句首的主语从句只能用whether来引导，同位语从句也只能用 whether 来引导。

False: The question is if the enemy is marching towards us.
Right: The question is whether the enemy is marching towards us.

5.不像宾语从句，在有表语从句的复合句中，主句时态和从句时态可以不一致。
Right: The question is who will travel with me to Beijing tomorrow.
Right: The question is why he cried yesterday.

6.that在表语从句中不可以省掉。表语从句只能置于主句之后，而主句的动词只能是 连系动词。
7.名词性从句在be等系动词后作表语时被称为表语从句。

The reason why I didn't go to France was (that I got) a new job. 
    A.because I got   B.because of getting
    C.got   D.that I got

He works too hard. That is (what) is wrong with him.
	A. that which  B. the what  C. what  D. the thing what

One reason why women live longer than men after retirement is (that) women can continue to do something they are used to doing.
	A. because  B. for  C. since  D. that
	
	
8.表语从句虚拟语气,
  通常表示建议、命令、要求、安排、决定等的名称做主语是,后跟表语从句,从句用虚拟语气"should+动词原型"的形式,而且经常会把 should 省略
  
	Thier advice is that we(should) leave at once. 他们建议我们马上离开
	
	Our only request is that this(should) be settled as soon as possible. 
	我们唯一的请求就是尽快解决这个问题
```

### 同位语从句

```wiki
I've come from Mr Wang with a message (that) he can't visit you this afternoon.
我从网先生那边得知一个消息,他说他今天下午不能来看你了

1.同位语从句与定语从句区分
We are glad at the news (that) he will come.  (同位语从句)
	听到他要来这个消息我们很高兴
We are glad at the news that he told us. (定语从句)
    听到他告诉我们的这个消息我们很高兴
    
2.分离式同位语从句
Nobody would stand out admitting the fact, for some reason, (that) they lost the game.
		某种原因,没有人会站出来承认他们输掉了比赛这一事实
		           等价
For some reason, nobody would stand out admitting the fact (that)  they lost the game.


The news must be true (that) these products will no longer be a available in the market.
		这些产品将不再市场上销售的消息一定是真的
		           等价
The news (that) these products will no longer be a available in the market must be true.


3.同位语从句中虚拟语气
通常那些表示建议、命令、要求、安排、决定的名词后跟同位语从句时,从句用虚拟语气"should+动词原型"的形式,而且经常会把"should"省略

The suggestion that the new rule(should) be adopted came from the chairman. 
		采纳新规则这个建议是主席提出的

		她请求立即请医生来

```
